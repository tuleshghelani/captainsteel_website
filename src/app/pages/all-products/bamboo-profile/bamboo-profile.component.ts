  faqs: FAQ[] = [
    {
      question: 'What makes bamboo profile sheets different from traditional roofing materials?',
      answer: 'Bamboo profile sheets represent a revolutionary sustainable alternative to conventional roofing. Unlike traditional materials, they\'re crafted from rapidly renewable bamboo fibers, which can be harvested in 3-5 years compared to decades for timber. The manufacturing process has a significantly lower carbon footprint than metal or cement-based materials. Bamboo profiles offer natural thermal and acoustic insulation properties, reducing energy costs. They\'re also notably lighter, reducing structural requirements and installation complexity. While providing comparable weather resistance and durability when properly treated, they bring the distinctive aesthetic of natural materials that ages gracefully, creating unique character over time that synthetic materials cannot replicate.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How durable are bamboo profile roofing sheets in different weather conditions?',
      answer: 'Our bamboo profile sheets undergo specialized treatment processes that ensure excellent durability across diverse climate conditions. They feature advanced water-resistant coatings that prevent moisture penetration, swelling, and warping, while UV-protective treatments prevent degradation from sun exposure. The natural density and fiber structure of bamboo provides inherent resistance to high winds, and the material demonstrates excellent thermal stability, withstanding temperature fluctuations without expansion or contraction issues common in other materials. In tropical environments, the sheets are treated to resist mold, mildew, and insect infestations. When properly installed and maintained, our bamboo profile sheets have a service life of 25+ years, comparable to many conventional roofing materials, while aging with a distinctive patina that many homeowners find aesthetically appealing.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What maintenance is required for bamboo profile roofing?',
      answer: 'Bamboo profile roofing requires minimal but specific maintenance to maximize its longevity. We recommend bi-annual inspections, ideally before and after monsoon or rainy seasons, to check for any signs of wear, loose fasteners, or accumulated debris. Regular cleaning with a soft brush to remove leaves, dirt, and organic matter helps prevent moisture retention. Unlike metal roofing, bamboo profiles don\'t require repainting, but we recommend reapplication of our UV-protective sealant every 3-5 years, depending on your climate conditions. Any damaged sections should be addressed promptly to prevent water infiltration. For coastal areas with high salt content in the air, a freshwater rinse every 3-4 months helps preserve the protective coatings. When properly maintained, our bamboo profiles develop a beautiful natural patina while maintaining their functional integrity throughout their 25+ year lifespan.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do bamboo profile sheets contribute to energy efficiency in buildings?',
      answer: 'Bamboo profile sheets significantly enhance building energy efficiency through multiple mechanisms. Their natural cellular structure provides exceptional thermal insulation with R-values typically 20-30% higher than standard metal roofing, reducing heating and cooling requirements year-round. The material\'s natural breathability helps regulate moisture and prevent heat buildup in attic spaces. Our bamboo profiles reflect up to 80% of solar radiation when installed with recommended underlayment, further reducing cooling costs in hot climates. Research indicates buildings with bamboo roofing can experience indoor temperature reductions of 5-8Â°C compared to conventional metal roofing during summer months, potentially reducing cooling costs by 15-25%. Additionally, the reduced weight of bamboo profiles minimizes embodied energy in supporting structures, while the sustainable harvesting and manufacturing process represents a 60-70% smaller carbon footprint compared to conventional roofing options, contributing to overall environmental efficiency.'
