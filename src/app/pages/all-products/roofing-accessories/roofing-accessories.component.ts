  faqs: FAQ[] = [
    {
      question: 'Why are quality roofing accessories important for my roofing system?',
      answer: 'Quality roofing accessories are critical because they complete the roofing system by sealing transitions, preventing water infiltration, and reinforcing vulnerable areas. While the roofing sheets themselves cover most of the surface, accessories address the joints, edges, and penetrations where most leaks occur. Using inferior accessories with premium roofing materials is like installing an expensive door with cheap hingesâ€”the system is only as strong as its weakest component. Premium accessories ensure your entire roofing system performs to its maximum potential, extends its lifespan, and maintains warranty coverage. Additionally, proper accessories improve aesthetic appeal, enhance energy efficiency, and can significantly reduce maintenance costs over the life of your roof.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What materials are used in your roofing accessories, and how do they ensure durability?',
      answer: 'Our roofing accessories are manufactured using premium materials specifically selected to withstand the same environmental challenges as the primary roofing system. For metal components like flashing, ridge caps, and fasteners, we use high-grade galvanized steel, stainless steel, or aluminum with specialized coatings that resist corrosion, UV degradation, and temperature extremes. Our adhesive and gaskets incorporate advanced polymer technologies including EPDM, butyl rubber, and silicone compounds engineered to maintain flexibility and adhesion despite years of expansion, contraction, and exposure to elements. Each accessory undergoes rigorous testing including accelerated weathering, salt spray resistance, and thermal cycling to ensure they will maintain their integrity throughout the roofing system\'s expected lifespan, even in the harshest environments.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do your accessories integrate with different roofing systems?',
      answer: 'Our accessories are designed with universal compatibility in mind while offering optimized performance for specific roofing systems. We produce both standard configurations that work across multiple roofing products and specialized accessories engineered for perfect integration with particular systems. For metal roofing, we offer profile-specific flashing and closure components that precisely match the corrugation pattern or trapezoidal shape of each sheet type. Our fastening systems are calibrated for different substrate materials, insulation thicknesses, and environmental requirements. For contractors and building owners working with multiple roofing types, we provide comprehensive compatibility guides and technical support to ensure the right accessory selection. Additionally, our engineering team can develop custom solutions for unique applications or challenging installation conditions where standard accessories might not be optimal.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you offer customized roofing accessories for special projects?',
      answer: 'Yes, we specialize in providing customized roofing accessories for projects with unique requirements or architectural specifications. Our manufacturing capabilities allow us to produce custom-length flashing, specialized trim profiles, non-standard colors, and accessories for unusual roof geometries or special applications. For large projects, we can develop bespoke accessory systems that address specific performance requirements such as enhanced wind resistance, specialized thermal characteristics, or unique aesthetic considerations. The customization process begins with a consultation with our technical team to understand your project needs, followed by design and engineering of the custom components, and quality-controlled manufacturing to ensure precise specifications are met. While custom accessories may require slightly longer lead times than standard items, they often result in superior performance, easier installation, and a more cohesive final appearance for your specialized roofing project.'
